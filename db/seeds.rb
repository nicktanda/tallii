# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# org = Organisation.create!(name: "Paws Oasis")

# linda = org.users.find_or_create_by!(
#   first_name: "Linda",
#   last_name: "Lalonde",
#   email: "linda.lalonde@gmail.com",
#   password: "password",
#   role: "admin",
#   max_daycare_visits: 10

# customer = org.users.find_or_create_by!(
#   first_name: "Customer",
